Introduction to Julia Using [citibike NYC data](http://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

## Installation Notes
This notebook was created using IJulia Notebook and Julia 0.3.5. Additionally, all packages used were at the newest release as of 2/18/15,
with the exception of DataFrames which was checked-out from master.

In order to see this notebook in its full glory, you'll need to install [live_reveal](https://github.com/damianavila/live_reveal) in order to see the slide transitions. Otherwise, the Notebook examples will work in linear order, it just won't be a "presentation".
